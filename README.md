# odin-recipes
A Project for a webpage about recipes written in HTML 

Things I have learned from this project: 
* Memorization of the HTML boilerplate
* Memorization of multiple HTML elements and attributes
* The usage of absolute and relative links through HTML elements
* Commits and Pushes through Git
